📊 Demographic Analysis of Disabled Population in India

📌 Project Overview

This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing the demographic distribution of the disabled population across India. The dashboard provides insights into disability types, gender distribution, rural/urban segmentation, and state-wise population trends using structured census-based data.

The objective of this project is to transform raw demographic data into meaningful analytical insights through data modeling, transformation, and visualization.

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Power BI Desktop

Power Query (M Language)

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)

Structured census dataset (~31,000+ records)

📂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains:
